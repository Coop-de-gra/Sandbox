### Intentions

* SLAM using RGB-D and an Xbox 360 Kinect. (Another option is ORB-SLAM using Logitech Camera OR LiDAR SLAM using RPLIDAR but its $99)


#### ROS Melodic on Pi 5

* Supersceded by ROS Noetic and targets Ubuntu 20.04 (instructions for Ubuntu 20.04 and ROS Noetic later in hackster.io post)
