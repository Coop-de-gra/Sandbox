### What would my bobber look like?

really inspired by this build: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T37QCOghzdo&ab_channel=LNSPLTBLVD

* Reduction (not elimination) of all the bells and whistles
* chopped rear end with shortened fender
* new led/projector headlight
* minimalist but also bright LED turn signals and tail lights
* curved license plate bracket
* struts between rear and frame
* comfortable seat
* low profile saddle bags
* bag below headlight
* Z bars / Mini Ape Bars / etc. ( I like the more sit up style of sitting )
* flat foot pegs not foward ones ( but im not too critical about this, i might like foward )
