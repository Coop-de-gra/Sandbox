    * Find the how (short and sweet)
      * Creating documentation to improve manual processes (work)
      * Research and how its essentially driven around productivity (personal life)
    * Find the what (why I’ve done the things I’ve done, and why im interested in tech)
      * Love for productive led me to engineering - ive since fell in love with what tech can offer
      * “Essentially got into engineering to make things better than what they are”
     
#### Why

* Yeah - real quick before I share a bit about myself, I do have a little speech impediment that causes me to stutter so it may come up as we chat, but its not because im nervous, im really excited to be here and learn more about the company. So again, my name is Cooper, happy to meet you all, and a large driving force in my life is Productivity.

* Some of the ways this guides me are finding ways at work to improve my teams efficiency with manual process and documentation and through my four years of research in college since research is essentially driven around productivity.

* My ambition for productivity is actually what led me to engineering in first place because I’ve always had an interest in making things better that what they are. I’ve seen what the nuclear and construction industry offers and now I’ve been inspired by the possibilities of the tech industry.

#### Pitch

* Just a quick heads-up before I dive in - I have a slight speech impediment that sometimes causes me to stutter, but it's not due to nerves, I’m genuinely excited to be here and learn more about the company. Again, my name is Cooper, it’s great to meet you all, and ***productivity*** is a core value that drives me. Some of the ways this principle shapes my work are by identifying areas to increase my team's efficiency around manual processes and documentation. Also, through my four years of research in college, productivity was always the focus. This drive for productivity is what led me to pursue engineering in the first place, as I’ve always been interested in finding ways to make things better. While the nuclear and construction industries are teaching me a lot, I’m now more inspired by how this new opportunity will align with my goals
