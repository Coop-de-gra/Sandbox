# High Value Algorithms

## Depth-First Search

* also known as DFS
* algorithm for searching a graph 
* depth = searches vertical nodes before horizontal nodes
* remember 'stack' - data structure that keeps track of the verticies we visit 

## Breadth-First Search

* also knows as BFS
* algo

## Sliding Window

## Backtracking
