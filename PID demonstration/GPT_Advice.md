Below is a high-level guide on how to wire up your components and implement a simple PID-based motor speed (or position) controller using:

- **Arduino** (for real-time PID loop)  
- **Raspberry Pi 5** (optional/high-level control or monitoring)  
- **N20 12 V DC motor** (preferably with an encoder)  
- **TB6612FNG** motor driver  
- **LM2596** step-down converter (for regulated 5 V supply)  
- **Breadboard** and **jumper wires**  

> **Important**: This guide assumes your N20 motor has some kind of feedback encoder (often sold as “N20 motor with hall-effect encoder” or “N20 motor with magnetic/optical encoder”). If you do NOT have an encoder (or some other sensor to measure speed/position), you cannot do closed-loop PID. You need feedback for PID to work.

## 1. System Overview

1. **Power Supply**  
   - You’ll need a 12 V supply (DC adapter, battery, etc.) that can provide enough current for your motor.
   - The **LM2596** step-down (buck) converter will create a stable 5 V from that 12 V line to power your Arduino, the logic side of the TB6612FNG, and possibly the Raspberry Pi 5 (although the Pi 5 often wants 5 V with enough current, so confirm your LM2596 can support that or use a dedicated supply for the Pi 5 if needed).

2. **Arduino**  
   - The Arduino reads the encoder signals (to measure speed or position) and computes the PID control output.
   - That PID output is sent via PWM signals to the TB6612FNG motor driver.

3. **TB6612FNG Motor Driver**  
   - Accepts a high-current 12 V input to power the motor.
   - Receives logic signals (PWM, direction, standby) from Arduino to drive the motor.

4. **Motor (N20, 12 V)**  
   - Connected to output terminals of the TB6612FNG.
   - The encoder lines go back to the Arduino for feedback.

5. **Raspberry Pi 5** (Optional in a first stage)  
   - You can either run your PID loop on the Pi if you configure real-time constraints (often trickier in Linux-based systems), or you can use the Pi for higher-level tasks: user interface, setpoint commands, data logging, etc.
   - A common approach is: Pi sets a desired speed or position, sends it to the Arduino via serial (USB or UART), and the Arduino executes the PID loop.

## 2. Wiring Diagram (Conceptual)

Here’s the conceptual breakdown of the main connections. (Pin names may vary slightly based on your exact board labels.)

1. **Power**  
   - **LM2596** input: 12 V from your main supply.  
   - **LM2596** output: 5 V →  
     - Arduino 5 V pin  
     - TB6612FNG Vcc (logic supply pin)  
     - Possibly the Raspberry Pi 5’s 5 V input (if your LM2596 can handle the current draw; otherwise, power the Pi with a dedicated 5 V supply).

2. **TB6612FNG**  
   - **Motor power (VMotor)**: 12 V supply (direct, not the 5 V).  
   - **Logic supply (Vcc)**: 5 V from the LM2596.  
   - **GND**: common ground with Arduino and the 12 V supply.  
   - **A01 and A02 (motor outputs)**: connect to the two leads of your N20 motor.  
   - **STBY**: tie to 5 V (through Arduino or directly) to enable the driver. (Sometimes you control STBY from an Arduino pin; if you do, make sure you set it high in code to enable the motor driver.)  
   - **AIN1, AIN2**: digital pins from Arduino for direction control.  
   - **PWMA**: Arduino PWM pin for speed control.  
   - **BIN1, BIN2, PWMB**: Not used if you only have one motor. (Or you could use them for a second motor if needed.)

3. **Motor Encoder**  
   - Typically, you’ll have two encoder output signals: **Encoder A** and **Encoder B** (or sometimes just one for simpler “tachometer” feedback).  
   - You’ll connect these to Arduino **interrupt-capable** pins (often digital pin 2 and 3 on the Arduino Uno, or other pins with interrupt support).  
   - You’ll also connect encoder ground and encoder Vcc (often 5 V or 3.3 V, depending on the encoder’s spec) to the same ground and 5 V supply from your LM2596 or Arduino.  
   - If the encoder runs at 5 V, just supply 5 V. If the encoder is a 3.3 V type, supply 3.3 V from a regulator and possibly use level shifting.

4. **Arduino**  
   - 5 V pin: from LM2596 output.  
   - GND pin: common ground.  
   - **PWM pin** (e.g., digital pin 9, 10, or 11 on Uno) → TB6612FNG PWMA.  
   - **Direction pins** (e.g., digital pins 7 and 8) → TB6612FNG AIN1, AIN2.  
   - **Interrupt pins** (digital pins 2 and/or 3) ← Motor encoder A/B.  
   - **STBY pin** (optional) → a digital pin that you set HIGH to enable the driver.

5. **Raspberry Pi 5** (if used for setpoint commands)  
   - You can connect the Pi to Arduino via USB or UART for serial communication.  
   - Ensure common GND across Pi, Arduino, motor driver, etc.  
   - The Pi can send commands like “Set Speed to X” or “Move to position Y,” and the Arduino’s firmware can respond.

## 3. Arduino Sketch (Example PID Speed Control)

Below is simplified example code for speed control using PID on an Arduino. It uses a typical PID loop to maintain a target RPM (revolutions per minute). You’d adapt it if you want position control instead (i.e., integrate the encoder counts and compare to a target position).

> **Note**: This example uses a very minimal “PID from scratch.” You can also use the Arduino PID library (`#include <PID_v1.h>`). The logic is the same.

```cpp
// Pins
const int encoderPinA = 2;    // Must be interrupt capable on many Arduinos
const int encoderPinB = 3;    // Optional for direction or improved resolution
const int motorPWMPin = 9;    
const int motorIn1Pin = 7;
const int motorIn2Pin = 8;
const int motorSTBYPin = 6;   // If you want to control STBY from code

// PID variables
volatile long encoderCount = 0;
long prevEncoderCount = 0;
unsigned long prevMillis = 0;
float currentRPM = 0.0;
float targetRPM = 100.0;      // Set your desired speed
float controlOutput = 0.0;

// PID gains - you'll have to tune these
float Kp = 2.0;
float Ki = 0.5;
float Kd = 0.1;

float integral = 0.0;
float lastError = 0.0;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);

  pinMode(encoderPinA, INPUT_PULLUP);
  pinMode(encoderPinB, INPUT_PULLUP);

  // Attach interrupt for encoder A
  attachInterrupt(digitalPinToInterrupt(encoderPinA), encoderISR, RISING);

  pinMode(motorPWMPin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(motorIn1Pin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(motorIn2Pin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(motorSTBYPin, OUTPUT);

  // Enable the motor driver
  digitalWrite(motorSTBYPin, HIGH);

  // Initialize outputs
  digitalWrite(motorIn1Pin, LOW);
  digitalWrite(motorIn2Pin, LOW);
  analogWrite(motorPWMPin, 0);
}

void loop() {
  unsigned long currentMillis = millis();
  
  // Calculate RPM every 100ms (adjust as needed)
  if (currentMillis - prevMillis >= 100) {
    long count = encoderCount;  // Copy volatile data safely
    encoderCount = 0;           // Reset for next interval
    
    // For an N20 motor with a certain encoder counts per revolution:
    // Suppose it's 11 pulses per revolution * 2 channels = 22 edges per revolution (example).
    // You need to confirm your exact encoder CPR (counts per revolution).
    // currentRPM = (count / pulsesPerRev) * (600 / interval_ms).
    // The formula depends on your encoder resolution and interval time.

    float pulsesPerRev = 20.0; // Example, depends on your actual motor’s encoder
    float intervalSec = (currentMillis - prevMillis) / 1000.0;
    currentRPM = (count / pulsesPerRev) / intervalSec * 60.0;
    
    prevMillis = currentMillis;
    
    // PID calculation
    float error = targetRPM - currentRPM;
    integral += error * 0.1;   // integrate over 0.1s intervals
    float derivative = (error - lastError) / 0.1;
    lastError = error;
    
    controlOutput = (Kp * error) + (Ki * integral) + (Kd * derivative);

    // Constrain the control output to [0, 255] for Arduino PWM
    if (controlOutput < 0) controlOutput = 0;
    if (controlOutput > 255) controlOutput = 255;

    // Write PWM
    setMotorPWM(controlOutput);

    // Debug print
    Serial.print("RPM: ");
    Serial.print(currentRPM);
    Serial.print("  Error: ");
    Serial.print(error);
    Serial.print("  Control: ");
    Serial.println(controlOutput);
  }
}

void encoderISR() {
  // Basic approach: increment count every rising edge on channel A
  // If you need direction sensing, read channel B or do a more advanced routine
  encoderCount++;
}

// Helper function to set motor direction + PWM
void setMotorPWM(float pwmVal) {
  // Example: always spin forward if target is positive. For direction control, check sign.
  digitalWrite(motorIn1Pin, HIGH);
  digitalWrite(motorIn2Pin, LOW);
  analogWrite(motorPWMPin, (int)pwmVal);
}
```

### Notes on the Code

1. **Encoder ISR**: A simple method is to increment `encoderCount` on each rising edge of the A channel. Some encoders require you to read both channels for proper direction decoding. If you only care about speed (not direction), incrementing on a single channel might be enough, but make sure you’re consistent with your pulses per revolution math.
2. **PID Loop Timing**: We compute speed once every 100 ms in this example, which might be okay for a small motor. You can do faster loops for more responsiveness (e.g., every 10 ms or 20 ms). Just note the faster you loop, the more CPU overhead and potential measurement noise.
3. **Tune Gains (Kp, Ki, Kd)**: The example values (2.0, 0.5, 0.1) are placeholders. You’ll need to tune them for your motor and mechanical load. Start with just P, then add I and D as necessary to reduce steady-state error and overshoot.
4. **Direction**: If you need the motor to reverse, you’ll set `motorIn1Pin=LOW` and `motorIn2Pin=HIGH` in your code based on the sign of your setpoint or error.

## 4. Using Raspberry Pi 5

If you want the **Pi 5** to be the “brain”:

1. You can run a Python script on the Pi that:
   - Reads user input (desired speed)  
   - Sends commands to the Arduino via USB or serial (e.g., “Set speed to 150 RPM”).  
   - Optionally receives feedback from the Arduino (current RPM, PID error, etc.) to display on a GUI or log in real time.

2. Alternatively, you can attempt to implement the entire PID loop on the Pi 5’s GPIO pins (directly reading encoders and outputting PWM to the TB6612FNG). But real-time performance on a standard Linux OS can be tricky—there may be jitter in the timing unless you use specialized techniques (like a real-time kernel or the Pi’s hardware PWM). For simpler, more reliable control, the Arduino approach is popular.

## 5. Step-by-Step Startup Procedure

1. **Power everything off.**  
2. **Wire the LM2596** so that it receives 12 V on its input and outputs a stable 5 V. Adjust the LM2596 with a multimeter if needed.  
3. **Wire the TB6612FNG** with the 12 V supply on VMotor, 5 V to Vcc, and grounds connected.  
4. **Connect the N20 motor** to the TB6612FNG outputs (A01, A02).  
5. **Connect the Arduino**:  
   - 5 V from LM2596 to Arduino 5 V pin, and GND to Arduino GND.  
   - TB6612FNG’s logic pins (AIN1, AIN2, PWMA, STBY) to Arduino digital/PWM pins.  
   - Motor encoder signals to Arduino digital pins 2 and/or 3 (with pullups if necessary).  
6. **Upload the example PID code** (adjust pins as per your wiring).  
7. **Power on** the 12 V supply. The Arduino gets 5 V from LM2596. The motor driver sees 5 V logic and 12 V motor power.  
8. **Open Serial Monitor** in the Arduino IDE to see real-time debug prints.  
9. **Adjust Gains**: If the motor overshoots or oscillates, reduce Kp or add some Kd. If there is a steady-state error, increase Kp or add some Ki.  

---

## 6. Tips and Troubleshooting

1. **Ensure Common Ground**: The 12 V supply negative, LM2596 negative, Arduino GND, and TB6612FNG GND must all be the same reference.
2. **Double Check Encoder**: Make sure you know the pulses per revolution (PPR or CPR) for your specific N20 encoder. Some are 11, some are 20, some are 50, etc. The total “edges” you count might be 4× that if you track rising/falling edges on both channels.  
3. **Noise & Filtering**: DC motors can introduce electrical noise, so sometimes adding small capacitors across the motor leads or from each lead to motor housing can help.  
4. **Load**: With a heavier mechanical load, you may need to retune the PID or supply more current. Watch for overheating of the TB6612FNG if your motor draws more current than the driver can handle.  
5. **Check the TB6612FNG datasheet** for maximum current specs (about 1–1.2 A continuous). If the N20 motor is high-torque or can stall above 1 A, you may need a bigger driver or ensure you never exceed that stall current.  
6. **If using the Raspberry Pi** for direct control, consider a real-time approach or at least ensure you read the encoders quickly enough in a stable loop. You can still use the TB6612FNG for motor power, but you’d connect the Pi’s GPIO pins to the driver’s AIN1, AIN2, PWMA, etc.  

---

## Summary

You absolutely can build a PID controller around an **Arduino + TB6612FNG + 12 V N20 motor** (with an encoder). The **LM2596** supplies a clean 5 V for logic, while you feed the motor driver with 12 V for the motor side. The encoder feedback goes to the Arduino, which runs a PID loop in software. You can then optionally use the **Raspberry Pi 5** for higher-level tasks—communicating setpoints, data logging, or a user interface. 

Good luck with your build, and don’t forget to tune your PID gains carefully for stable and responsive control!
