intent: Use iPhone and equip it to be a filming rig
---
### how
* Small chest rig like they use to wrap cars
* 10k mAh portable battery
* Small portable external drive
* iphone lav/lapel mic
* use apple watch to start/stop video
* maybe a led mini light

### idea
* chest rig iphone filming setup
* each attachment must connect to chest rig
* i want to be able to work hands free and while filming
* easier to move footage onto computer

### notes
* cant record video while also writing video to portable SSD
    * this is good because it solves the issue of trying to charge my phone but also record while also not running out of space on my phone
* also saves my computer storage / phone storage from housing the film
* need to find a better video editor
