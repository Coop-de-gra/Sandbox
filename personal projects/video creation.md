intent: Use iPhone and equip it to be a filming rig
---
### how
* Small chest pack like they use to wrap cars
* 10k mAh portable battery
* Small portable external drive
* iphone lav/lapel mic
* use apple watch to start/stop video
* maybe a led mini light
  * like this: https://a.co/d/4fXsqsr

### why
* chest rig iphone filming setup
* each attachment must connect to chest rig
* i want to be able to work hands free and while filming
* easier to move footage onto computer

### idea
* 3d print flat panel to add rigidity & mount things to
  * cant mount everything to fabric - too flimsy
  * can use my threaded inserts, magnets, straps, etc
* custom mount for everything
  * Phone mount to place back of the camera outward and center in chest
  * battery mount
  * SSD mount
  * Light mount
* dont have to mount everything outside of the pack, can mount things inside or just lay them inside

### notes
* cant record video while also writing video to portable SSD
    * this is good because it solves the issue of trying to charge my phone but also record while also not running out of space on my phone
* also saves my computer storage / phone storage from housing the film
* need to find a better video editor
