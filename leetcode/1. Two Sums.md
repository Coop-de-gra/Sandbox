## problem
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

 

* ***Example 1:***

  * Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
  * Output: [0,1]
  * Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

* ***Example 2:***

  * Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
  * Output: [1,2]

* ***Example 3:***

  * Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
  * Output: [0,1]
 

***Constraints:***

2 <= nums.length <= 104
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
-109 <= target <= 109
Only one valid answer exists.

## thoughts
### initial
* working with an array
* each case has only one solution
* have to use a loop to iterate through each array index item
* output should point to index items that add to target #
* brute force method and optimize

### wokring
* can't figure out how to do a test print on one of the array index
  * dont think i can print an array item since its not int?

## things to note
* you can import factory classes to solve problems
* need to use HashMap to assign Int values to arary Indicies (key/value pairs)

## playground
```
class Solution {

     // Method twoSums, will return int[], inputs are nums and target, will output items in array int[]
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {

         // uses javas factory methods, Map/HashMap, to create a new map that stores integer keys and integer values
        Map<Integer, Integer> numsToIndexMap = new HashMap<>();
        
         // Get the size of the input array
        int sizeOfArray = nums.length;

         // Loop through the array
        for(int i = 0; i < sizeOfArray; i++) {
             // Calculate the difference between the target and the current number
            int diff = target - nums[i];

             // Check if the difference already exists in the map
            if(numsToIndexMap.containsKey(diff)) {
                 // If it exists, return the indices of the current number and the number that adds up to the target
                return new int[]{i, numsToIndexMap.get(diff)};
            }

             // If it doesn't exist, add the current number and its index to the map
            numsToIndexMap.put(nums[i], i);
        }

         // If no two numbers add up to the target, return null
        return null;
    }
}
```
