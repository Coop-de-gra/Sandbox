## problem
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

 

* ***Example 1:***

  * Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
  * Output: [0,1]
  * Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

* ***Example 2:***

  * Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
  * Output: [1,2]

* ***Example 3:***

  * Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
  * Output: [0,1]
 

***Constraints:***

2 <= nums.length <= 104
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
-109 <= target <= 109
Only one valid answer exists.

## thoughts
### initial
* working with an array
* each case has only one solution
* have to use a loop to iterate through each array index item
* output should point to index items that add to target #
* brute force method and optimize

### wokring
* can't figure out how to do a test print on one of the array index
  * dont think i can print an array item since its not int?

## things to note
* you can import factory classes to solve problems
* need to use HashMap to assign Int values to arary Indicies (key/value pairs)

## playground
```
import java.util.Hashmap;

class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
       HashMap<Integer, Integer> twoSumsMap = new HashMap<>();
       int sizeOfArray = nums.length;
       for(int i = 0; i < sizeOfArray; i++) {    // creates int i, ='s it to 0, uses the size of the array to limit loops'
            int diff = target - nums[i];
            if(twoSumsMap.containsKey(diff)){
                
            }

       }
    }
}
```
