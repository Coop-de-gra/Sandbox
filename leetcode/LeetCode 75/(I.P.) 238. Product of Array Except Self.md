### 238. Product of Array Except Self

https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=leetcode-75

### tip

```
Think how you can efficiently utilize prefix and suffix products to calculate
the product of all elements except self for each index. Can you pre-compute the
prefix and suffix products in linear time to avoid redundant calculations?
```

### algo (personal attempt)
* through reading solutions (unfortunately) the answer is solved by finding product of everything, and then dividing each element by the overall product.
* need to skip first element in the array
* 

### code (personal attempt)
```
class Solution {
    public int[] productExceptSelf(int[] nums) {
        
    }
}
```
