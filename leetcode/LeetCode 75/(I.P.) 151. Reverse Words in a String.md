### algo (personal try)

* convert string into char
* two pointers that work front to back and stop at spaces
* every char between spaces will be collected
* when it reaches a space it waits for the other pointer
* then the two pointers switch the words and index one char foward and repeat the algo
* two pointers stop when they become equal
* char is converted to string and outputted
