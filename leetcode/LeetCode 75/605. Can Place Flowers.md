                    flowerbed[i] = 1;
                    count++;

}

## algorithm

need to look at flower # `n`

need to look at consecutive open slots in `flowerbed`

need to determine mathmatically consecutive open plots vs flower  #s

one flower needs 3 consecutive  plots, 2 flowers need 5 consecutive plots etc

maybe a for-each loop with if statements that counts consecutive open or closed plots?
