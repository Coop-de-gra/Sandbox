```

## interpretation

creates a generic `List` that will store `boolean` objects. 

list is called `kidsWithCandies` and uses `candies` (int array because of `[]`) and `extraCandies` as inputs


## plan of attack

need to access each array item one by one (loop)

add extra candies to each item w/o changing the original value

compare the new value to original values of other array items 

if true return true, if false return false

index boolean array one by one as im outputting true or false


## working thoughts

don't forget to reference documentation on arrays, array methods, and what not
