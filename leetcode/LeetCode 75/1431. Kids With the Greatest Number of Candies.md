```
class Solution {
    public List<Boolean> kidsWithCandies(int[] candies, int extraCandies) {
        // Find out the greatest number of candies among all the kids.
        int maxCandies = 0;
        for (int candy : candies) {
            maxCandies = Math.max(candy, maxCandies);
        }
        // For each kid, check if they will have greatest number of candies among all the kids.
        List<Boolean> result = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int candy : candies) {
            result.add(candy + extraCandies >= maxCandies);
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```

## deconstruction

- `for (int candy : candies)` - the `:` in this for loop makes it a for-each loop (enhanced for loop)
    - used to iterate over an array
    - reads: for each candy in the array candies
 
- `maxCandies = Math.max(candy, maxCandies)
    - uses the Math class and max method to find the largest value of x (candy) and y (maxCandies)
    - assigns the result to `maxCandies`
 
- List<Boolean> result = new ArrayList<>();
    - creates a new array list (and calss it result) for what I was saying earlier - we need a way to add cadies without changing the initial array values
 
- `result.add(candy + extraCandies >= maxCandies);`
    - uses the `.add` ArrayList method to add candy and extraCandies together
    - compares it to maxCandies to return a boolean

- `return result;`
    - returns the boolean array produced from result enhanced for loop

## interpretation

creates a generic `List` that will store `boolean` objects. 

list is called `kidsWithCandies` and uses `candies` (int array because of `[]`) and `extraCandies` as inputs


## plan of attack

need to access each array item one by one (loop)

add extra candies to each item w/o changing the original value

compare the new value to max candies value

if true return true, if false return false

index boolean array one by one as im outputting true or false

## algorithm

create integer called max candies, initialize it with 0

iterate over candies and perform max Candies = max(maxCandies, candy) to get the greatest


## working thoughts

don't forget to reference documentation on arrays, array methods, and what not

`public List<Boolean>` - creates a boolean list array called kidsWithCandies

`(int[] candies, int extraCandies)` - the inputs elements to the list are the other array `candies` and the int `extraCandies`

editorial solution mentioned "ad hoc" (latin meaning "for this")
    - in Java, refers to Ad hoc Polymorphism (single function works in different ways depending on inputs)


## things that wont work

method must return a boolean so cant expect it to return int or what not
