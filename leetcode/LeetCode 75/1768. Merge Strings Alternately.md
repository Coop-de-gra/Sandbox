## Lessons

- remember **_String_** is a class that has factory built in methods
- this example teaches the immutability of the String class
    - unable to be changed
    - so we will be using StringBuilder (java.lang.StringBuilder)
- For performance use StringBuilder or consider processing the string as a character array
- use online resources to learn more about the language
    - ex. string methods useful in this question: https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_ref_string.asp

## Deconstruction

- `StringBuilder` - creates a mutable string, is a factory package
- `.length()` - String method, returns the length of a specified string
    - used to compare length to `i` thus influencing the # of loops
- `.append()` - method of StringBuilder (java.lang.StringBuilder), append the string representation of some argument to the sequence
- `toString()` - return a strings value, better than System.out.println() as it's an elementary approach and not needed
