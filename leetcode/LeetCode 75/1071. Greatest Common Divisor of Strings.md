## notes

- GCD (Euclid's Algorithm) & Recursion
    - yield the remainder of the two numbers with `%`, remainder is the GCD
- use string `.length()` to find int used in algorithm

## explanation

- `.length()` - gets the int's needed for the algorithm
- `.equals()` - compares strings to see if they are equal
- `(str1 + str2).equals(str2 + str1)` - A + B = B + A
    - really only relates to leet codes 3 test cases and passes the 3rd test case.
    - Wouldn't be useful in other situations.
- `int gcdLength = gcd(len1, len2)` - created method `gcd` with two arguments `len1` & `len2`
- `substring`- creats a new string from `str1` and copies over the characters from `0` to the int `gcdLength`
- `private int gdc` - methods are recognized anywhere in the class during compilation. Execution order depends on method calls not method placement.
    - for readability, place helper methods below main methods they support


- **FINALLY**, this method supports `gcd` in the `gcdOfStrings()` public method. and it defines the math aspect of it
- `return b == 0 ? a : gcd(b, a % b)` - this is the **recursive implementation of the Euclidean algorithm**
- `b == 0` checks to see is whatever b is, is zero
- `? a` - return a if b is indeed 0
- `gcd(b, a % b)` the algorithm calls itself with new values, a is now the new current value of b, b is now the remainder of a % b

## important (very)

```
private int gcd(int a, int b) {
    return b == 0 ? a : gcd(b, a % b);
```
- essentially, the private gdc method is a while loop
    - it is delaring itself as `gdc` with two arguments `int a` and `int b`
    - but it also lists itself in its definition which then creates a loop as it tries to define itself
    - the loop finally stops when b == 0, which in turn, defines gcd = a
